Before I begin this post, you should know that unless your username is “I-love-sluts”, your pseudonym probably won’t make or break your success rate. But giving something a name makes it memorable, and you’re more likely to gain traction with a good one.

**A few tips on picking your username:**

- **Avoid including your full name.** It’s a bit of a safety issue, and it takes out the mystery of meeting someone new when their name is “MartinColeLikesYou”
- **Avoid negative, pessimistic, or rude names.** Like “NeverFindThe1” or “OnlySkinnyChicks”
- **Put in a little bit of effort.** Maybe it’s a pun on your favorite book. Or one of your interests. Like “50ShadesofHeyyy” or “3Cheers4Mavericks” or “PaintersAnonymous"
- **Keep it light-hearted.** Try and steer clear of heavy phrases like “LookingForLuv123” or “FuturePerfectDad”
